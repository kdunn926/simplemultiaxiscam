# Very simple, yet well documented program to generate G-Code for **4 and 5 axis** CNC machines. #

## status ##

**Beta version, preparing V1.0**

tested to work but not user friendly enough yet. Also some non-critical features that users expect are missing.

**IN NEED OF:**
  * **Testers** (this means YOU)
  * Developers
  * People skilled in trigonometry and 3D data structures.

See the [issues](http://code.google.com/p/simplemultiaxiscam/issues/list) list about what is done and needs doing.
The code is well commented and structured and it should be easy to implement some of the smaller features within an hour or two.
